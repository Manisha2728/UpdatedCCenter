          Determines whether to allow members of the patient's Care Team to access the patient's psychiatric data by adding Psychiatric permissions (Code: Psy, Code System: 2.16.840.1.113883.5.25) to the Provider's security permissions.
          <br>
           The Patient-Provider relationship exists when both the Patient and the Provider are related to the same Care Team. The Provider's Care Team is managed as an Organization, which is defined as a Care Team if the Code ID (of the Organization)  is under the CareTeam sub domain. The Patient's Care Team is managed as a PrimaryCareProvider, which is defined as a Care Team if the Code ID (of the PrimaryCareProvider) is under the CareTeamLink subdomain.
           <br>
            To define the Provider's Care Team, the Provider's National ID value (configured in the Active Directory) is used to associate the Provider to the relevant Medical Staff Identifier (ID extension) in the CDR that defines the Provider's Care Team.
            <br>
             The configuration of the Provider's National ID value is performed in the following CCenter location:  Security &gt; Managed Users &gt; National ID.
             <br>
              To define the Medical Staff ID root, the EHR User Assigning Authority value must be configured in the following CCenter location: Agent Hub &gt; EHR Integration &gt; Properties Packages.
              <br>
               If the Patient and Provider have overlapping Care Team values,  this indicates that the Patient-Provider relationship exists. In this case the Psychiatric permission will be added to the User.
